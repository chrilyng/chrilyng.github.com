[Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) is an IDE based on IntelliJ made by Jetbrains and supported by Google.

It depends heavily on Gradle for building projects. This has passed version 2 and the project setup is quite mature and requires little migration between versions.

The 'IntelliSense' support is great in IntelliJ because it's camelcase sensitive compared to Eclipse.
It almost writes your code for you by predicting references to variables and methods etc.

Finally Android is approaching a clear style. I might contribute my own application soon.
