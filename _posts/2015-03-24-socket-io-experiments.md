[Socket.IO](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) made a fun example to get the hang of their library that uses the Express framework for Node.JS.

Initial impressions:

* It was quite easy to setup install npm and NodeJS on Ubuntu through apt-get

* I understand how powerful Node and Javascript is for event based server side scripting for web applications

You can see my own [experiments](https://github.com/chrilyng/socket-io-chat-experiment) with the framework where I try to implement some of the suggestions from the guide.
