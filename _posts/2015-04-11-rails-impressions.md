[Ruby on Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) is a web framework similar to Django in that it uses commands for creation of model, view and controllers.

There are some advantages to Rails:

* Concise dynamic markup
* Clear distinction of controllers and views using routes
* Reversing the generation of model from classes to schemas instead of schemas to classes makes for a more natural workflow

If you can get used to the generator for creating classes then Rails can really improve the efficiency of web development.
