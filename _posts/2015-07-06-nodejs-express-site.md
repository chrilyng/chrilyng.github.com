I started building a website based on data provided from Copenhagen municipality about toilet locations. 

It uses Jade and Express running on NodeJS with MongoDB based on the website example provided from CloudControlled.
Jade cuts down the HTML syntax to the minimal information and makes creating views easier.

You can find a work in progress deployment (in Danish) [here](https://kk-toilets.herokuapp.com/)
